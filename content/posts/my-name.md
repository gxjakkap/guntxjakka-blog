To start off, My nickname in Thai is Gunt (กันต์) which means ว. น่าใคร่ น่าพอใจ งดงาม เช่น กันตาภิรมย์ หมายถึง ยินดียิ่งในสิ่งที่น่าพอใจ. (Adv. Satisfactory, beloved) and the letter “t” at the back is silenced.

The origin of “GuntxJakka” starts when I need a new Instagram username. And I saw one of my seniors at school use their nickname x 2 first syllables of the real name. So mine would be “GuntxJakka” and I felt like hey, That’s a cool name! So I use this name everywhere after that.

For my in-game name, Autumn an flyflyaway_. These two have a funny similar origin. You know, like if your name looks like a girl, You will get benefits from your teammate. So I name my Minecraft account flyflyaway_ and my Steam account Autumn (How I get the name Autumn is I just randomly search google “girl name” lol).

So that’s it for today. See ya later!
